# Changelog

All notable changes to Warframe Commander are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
once it reaches a released version. Until then, everything lives under
**Unreleased**.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial repository scaffolding and `.gitignore` for a Next.js project.
- Seeded the `ai-tools` spec-driven toolkit into the repo: the `.specify/`
  Spec-Kit engine (templates + PowerShell scripts), `.claude/` agents,
  commands, and `speckit-*` skills, the `stacks/` convention packs, and the
  always-on operating context (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `MANIFEST.md`).
- Project process docs: `CHANGELOG.md` and `STATUS.md`.
- Next.js 16 (App Router) application scaffold — TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4,
  ESLint, Turbopack; `app/` at the repo root with the `@/*` import alias.
  Verified with a clean `next build`.
- Linked the repository to the Vercel project
  `jupchurch-7994s-projects/warformcommander` (Next.js framework preset).

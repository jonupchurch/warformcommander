# Operating rules — working in a codebase, fast and well

> Portable, tool-neutral instructions for any coding agent (Claude Code,
> Cursor, etc.). This file and `CLAUDE.md` travel into the target repo
> alongside `.claude/` and `.specify/`. The **target codebase's own
> conventions always win** where they conflict with anything here.
> Full rationale lives in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`; the one-page
> time-boxed/interview version is `docs/interview-cheat-sheet.md`; the routable
> catalog of every toolkit asset (agents, commands, skills, stacks) is
> `MANIFEST.md`.

This applies whether you're building greenfield in a project you own or
dropped into an unfamiliar codebase — and sometimes under live time
pressure. Optimize for a **narrow, correctly-scoped, actually-working**
result over a broad, half-built one.

## The nine rules

1. **Clarify before building.** State the ask, acceptance criteria, and
   explicit non-goals before writing code. Ambiguous? Ask whoever owns the
   requirement. Can't ask right now? Say the assumption out loud so it can be
   corrected early.
2. **Validate trust boundaries.** Anything user- or system-controlled (form
   input, request bodies, query params) gets validated before use — using the
   codebase's *existing* validation convention. Never trust client state for
   authorization; check it server-side.
3. **Match existing conventions.** The repo's design system, code style, file
   layout, and test patterns are the source of truth — someone else's repo or
   your own. Find the nearest existing analog and follow its shape; on a fresh
   project, establish conventions deliberately and hold to them. Say why out
   loud when you deviate.
4. **Scope discipline.** Ship the smallest complete slice that satisfies the
   ask. A good idea outside the ask gets *named* ("worth doing, but separate"),
   not silently folded in.
5. **Verify before "done."** Run the suite, exercise the golden path plus the
   most obvious edge case, run the build/typecheck, read back your own diff.
   Distinguish "I believe this works" from "I checked this works."
6. **Narrate the reasoning.** Say what you're about to do and why, especially
   for non-obvious calls. In a live setting the narration *is* the record; in
   normal work it complements the commit history (rule 9).
7. **Plan the whole feature set first.** For a new project's initial set of
   features, spec and plan *all* of them (`speckit-specify` → `speckit-plan`
   across the set) before implementing any — so shared models, cross-feature
   dependencies, and build order surface on paper, not mid-build.
8. **Test at the right level.** Unit tests for any code where they carry real
   signal (logic, edge cases, branching), using the language's standard tools
   and the repo's conventions; end-to-end tests for critical user paths a unit
   test can't reach (e.g. Playwright for web). Skip a test only where it adds
   no signal — deliberately, not silently.
9. **Commit often, atomically; branch per feature.** Work on a feature branch,
   not the default branch. Small atomic commits that each build and pass tests,
   messages in the repo's style. Merge back only once the feature is complete
   and verified.

## The loop

**New project:** plan the full initial feature set first (rule 7). Then, per
feature: orient (fast) → clarify scope → plan → implement on a feature branch
(match conventions, write tests alongside, commit atomically) → verify → merge
→ narrate throughout.

Skip the per-change plan only for genuinely trivial changes. **Time-boxed live
work** (a live interview/client session) is the exception: cut ceremony — plan
lighter, branch/commit as the setting allows — but never cut clarification,
verification, or the testing bar.

## Red flags to catch yourself on

- Writing code before you can state acceptance criteria in one sentence.
- Implementing on a fresh project before the feature set has been planned.
- "While I'm in here, I could also…" — name it as future work, don't fold it in.
- "I think this works" without having run it — or shipping logic that clearly
  warrants a test with no test.
- A new pattern/style that matches nothing already in the repo.
- Committing straight to the default branch, or a sprawling non-atomic commit.
- Going quiet for a long stretch instead of narrating.
